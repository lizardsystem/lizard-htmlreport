Introduction
------------
This Django app can be used to generate DOCX and PDF reports from 
plain XHTML documents.

It provides:

 * A view for on-demand generation of the output reports.
 * A management command which generates reports. These generated reports 
   are given timestamped filenames and are stored on disk.
 * A Django date-based generic view which renders an archive with the
   generated files.

Usage, etc.
